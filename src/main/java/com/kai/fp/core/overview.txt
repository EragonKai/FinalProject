top-down rotmg-esque game

multiple worlds?
on start, world is loaded from text file with letters representing objects/floor/stuff
world is stores in very large array of game objects?
camera centers on player and updates/draws all other objects inside it's "display"
    - every loop checks if objects are inside camera and if they are then update
    - player/camera have an x and y relative to the world but the camera handles drawing on display

random enemies and items loaded from xml
enemies spawn in increasing waves and
